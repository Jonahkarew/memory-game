## Memory Game

https://jonahkarew.github.io/memory-game/

## Motivation

This project was build with react and react states in order to create a memory game in theme with one of my all-time favorite franchises.

## Tech used

react, create-react-app, javascript, and images sourced from bulbapedia

## Use
The goal of the game is to click all 151 images without repeating a single time. To initially shuffle the cards, just click any image. 
After the intial shuffle, every click will increase the users score. However, if the user clicks an image that has already been clicked then the users score is set back to 0. The high-score of that session is logged in the react state and will begin incrementing once a new high-score is reached.


The game is played by clicking on the images without repeating, when an image is clicked twice the score resets and the highscore is kept persistant through the session.

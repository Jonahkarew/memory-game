## Memory Game

https://jonahkarew.github.io/memory-game/

## Motivation

This project was build with react and react states in order to create a memory game in theme with one of my all-time favorite franchises.

## Tech used

react, create-react-app, javascript, and images sourced from bulbapedia

## Use

The game is played by clicking on the images without repeating, when an image is clicked twice the score resets and the highscore is kept persistant through the session.
